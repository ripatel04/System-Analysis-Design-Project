The goal of this project is to create an all-inclusive zoo management system. The system is intended to make managing zoo operations—including visitor and animal data, ticket sales, and reporting—more efficient.  

Zoo Management System and features  

**User Verification:**  
Staff and admin users can log in securely.  
Access control that is different for administrators (full access) and personnel (restricted access).   

**Ticketing and Visitor Management:**  
Employees have the ability to add, amend, and remove visitor data.  
Visitors can use this method to purchase tickets, with costs determined by the number of people, children, and retirees.  

**Management of Animals:**  
Animal records can be viewed, added to, updated, and deleted by the admin.  
Complete information about the animal, such as name, species, weight, gender, date of birth, and immunization history.  

**Reporting:**  
Provide reports on the sales of tickets, visitor details, and animal information.  
Keep track of the cost and validity of your tickets.  

**Database Schema:**  
Tables for users, tickets, animals, visitors, and the interactions between visitors and tickets.  
SQL scripts for every table's CRUD actions.  

**Interface User:**  
Easy to use and intuitive design featuring a charming koala motif.  
Simple access to the various areas (reports, admin page, staff page).  

**Non-essential Conditions:**  
Quick and easy ticket ordering procedure; tickets may be processed and sent out in as little as one minute.  
strong security with distinct employee IDs (passwords and usernames).
